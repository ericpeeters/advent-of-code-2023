# Advent of Code 2023

My goal for this years AOC is not to go fast, but to try to come up with clever and straightforward solutions to fix the problems and maybe learn some more about data structure and algorithms along the way.

## Dev

I use `npx nodemon ./src/dayX/partX.ts` to develop the end solution and `npm run test X` to run the unit tests for a specific day.
